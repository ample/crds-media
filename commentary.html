        <p>Having just finished reading a pair of musical memoirs, Phil Collins' "Not Dead Yet" and Robert Hilburn's "Paul Simon:
        The Life", I'm full of gratitude for my musical career that never was. As a once-ambitious songwriter, my loftiest
        goals had me ending up somewhere between these two singer/songwriters' places in the musical firmament. But when
        looking at Collins' dire admissions (in the 1990s, he had #1 albums both with Genesis and as a solo artist, and created
        the soundtrack for Disney's massive animated hit, Tarzan. During this time he was divorced for the third time,
        estranged from his mistress, and a raging, daily dependent alcoholic. He says it was the worst time of his life) and
        Simon's troubles (his huge success in his mid-twenties made him feel alienated from his parents, his friends, his
        soon-to-be ex-wife, and his musical partner, Art Garfunkel. He retreated to a house in the woods and 3x/weekly
        therapy.) I'm reminded that God's scorecard for success is about family and faithfulness, NOT fame and fortune. So,
        much thanks to Phil and Paul for their warnings.</p>

                  He should have been a cultural fad. On Monday night, Henry Winkler won the first Emmy in his 42 year career.
