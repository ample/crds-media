  title: Wash the Sheets, Skip the Advice
  body: |-
    "Your kids LIKE to come home --- how did you do it?" is a question my husband and I are asked frequently. My typical answer is --- I dunno. As I lead the kids and student teams at our church you may think I'd have a more helpful response, but we couldn't think of anything intentional we'd done to make it happen. Our kids are pretty independent and three of them have kids of their own. But they do still like to come home. As I talked to my friends I heard stories of adults who only do the obligatory visit over the holidays or don't go home at all.

    When our kids were little, we weren't intentionally doing anything to insure they'd keep coming around as they grew. Most days we were more focused on making it to bedtime or keeping their butts dry and their bellies fed. When our kids were in their teens and early 20's I heard a talk where we, as parents, were challenged to take a long term view of parenting. Parenting isn't just about training, it's also about building a relationship that will last into adulthood, long after they're out of the house. We tried to encourage independence, while continuing to strengthen our family unit. But that still didn't answer the question --- why do they come home?

    I was curious, so I asked my kids --- what makes our home a place you want to come back to and what makes you think twice about getting in the car and popping over.

    I asked friends too. I was amazed by the emotion in their responses. This question hit a nerve. It brought up wonderful memories and really painful ones too. Even people who didn't want to go back home hoped to write a different story for their growing families. While the responses and experiences varied greatly, everyone desired a place where they felt safe, loved and known. A place where they could retreat. Whether their parents' home was that place or not, all had a desire to have a place to call home. Here are some of the common threads throughout their stories.

    Clean sheets matter

    This one surprised me, but speaks to a broader desire. We want to know that we're expected and wanted. Crumbs in the bed do not convey we're glad you're here. To make it easier for our kids and their families to drop by we keep diapers stocked in every size (with six grandkids who are 3-years-old and younger --- all sizes get used) and a few toys and books to keep the littles occupied. Having clean sheets and a few basic kid supplies conveys to our adult kids that we want them to come home.

    Kids will be kids, so hide the valuables and buy dark furniture

    Kids are messy. They spill things. Adult kids can also be messy and often spill things. So either buy furnishings that won't show the wear or be okay with spills. One mom shared, "I used to marvel at the fact that my mother-in-law had very light carpet and yet did not worry about her grandkids spoiling anything. They were allowed to be kids." I once went to a home where my 2-year-old was given a china tea set while I was told "kids need to learn to take care of valuable things." That was not a warm and welcoming place for us. It also was not a safe place for the china tea set. Don't hold kids, big and little ones, to expectations that are impossible to meet. Accidents happen.

    Talk with your adult children

    For some who grew up in a home they couldn't wait to leave, creating a welcoming environment is hard. "I struggle with how to create a happy home for my own adult kids to come back to because I never experienced it myself. I see my kids gravitating toward in-laws families and that stings." Another shared that when her father confessed, "I don't know how to love my adult kids well but I want to" the door to great conversations was blown open. If you think your kids might be avoiding you, talk with them. Ask what would make them feel loved and excited to be home. And if you ask, be prepared to make changes and adapt to their ever changing needs.

    Food feeds more than bellies

    Food was often mentioned as important in making a house feel like a home. "I love going home because I know what to expect. I know what it will smell like and what food we'll be eating. There's so much in our world that changes and that we can't control, but those small pieces of sameness are reassuring and comforting." Start family dinners when kids are little and we're more likely to enjoy meals with our kids when they're grown. Meatloaf and mashed potatoes was the meal our youngest son always picked for his birthday dinner. Recently his little family was going through a really hard and scary time. Guess what he asked me to make when I visited --- meatloaf and mashed potatoes. It filled his belly, comforted his hurting heart and brought a piece of his childhood into his chaotic situation.

    Bite your tongue when tempted to advise without an invitation

    How important is that wisdom that you so desperately want to impart? Does your opinion about their car purchase or your grandkids' dietary needs really need to be shared now? Offering advice when advice has not been requested is a great way to shut down communication with our adult children. One friend summed it up well, "I want to go pretty much anywhere where people listen without always trying to offer advice and fix me. That builds trust so that when the time is right there is a place for counsel." So when we're tempted to advise, instead let's close our mouth, open our ears and listen.

    Put away your electronics --- I'm talking to you grandma

    It's hard to focus on the people in the room when you're glued to a screen. Nothing communicates "you're just not that important" more than checking social media or catching up on a favorite show while family is around. "It's hard when the TV is on all the time because there is less engaging happening. If I wanted to watch TV we could do that at home." Let's turn off the TV and enjoy the people sitting in our home. Play a game. Make some play-doh. Take a walk.

    Remember what it was like to have young kids and teenagers

    Parenting is hard. Often our adult kids are in the midst of challenges when they come home. Simple things like changing a diaper or refraining from correcting a rude teenage grandchild is helpful in creating a home that is safe and welcoming. "Loving my kids unconditionally and helping with some of the basic tasks is the best way to love me." Also, we must be willing to change our schedule. As adults, we can adapt to dinner time changes much more easily than toddlers. Schedule mealtime when it's best for the kids. This is an easy way to create a welcoming environment.

    Remember the Bravermans from the hit TV show Parenthood? There is a reason so many went out and bought lights for their backyards after watching the Braverman family, dysfunction and all, gather around that long table in their beautifully lit backyard. We want that for ourselves and our kids. A place where we can return. A place where our cares and responsibilities are few. A place where we don't have to decide what's for dinner. A place where we feel loved, known and safe. A place where we're stingy with judgement but generous with food and encouragement. A place where even for a moment someone else is in charge and we can sit back and relax. It's not about the physical structure, but about the people who live there.

    One young mom shared "Our faith in Jesus has been an important influence because when you have experienced the manner in which Jesus has loved you, you should be motivated to love and forgive in the same way." Loving someone requires sacrifice and growing a relationship means the desires of the other may take priority over our own.

    The Bible says, "Children are a gift from the Lord. The children born to us are our special reward." (Psalm 123:3--4, NLV) Children are a gift no matter their age. In order to fully enjoy this gift, as they grow into adulthood we must be ready to adapt and make sacrifices so that our relationship will continue to grow and thrive. Our kids do the same. They sacrifice for us. The fruit of that sacrifice and changing relationships is a houseful of kids, lots of laughter and messes with plenty of food and fun. So regardless of the type of family we were born into, it's not too early or too late to consider how we can build a home that will draw our kids back for years to come.

  title: "“Be True to Yourself” is a Sham"
  body: |-
    We are being misled. There’s a massive fraud being exercised on all of Western humanity. It started with Shakespeare in Hamlet, and it is now a required charge in every celebrity commencement address that wasn’t canceled by campus protests. It’s the backbone of every advice column, and every conversation with a friend who just can’t figure out what to do next. And the key to having a great 2018 is to recognize it and kick it to the curb.

    This monster is the call to “be true to yourself!” (BTTYS) Or, as Shakespeare put it, “To thine own self be true.”

    Yes, it sounds enlightened to say, and it’s well-meaning, but that phrase ringing in the back of our minds consistently leads to frustration and chaos. It causes us to step all over other people. It’s why most of us feel so stuck. And it needs to go. Instead, there’s a better way that many people of faith have known for thousands of years.

    First, let’s be honest and acknowledge that no one agrees on what BTTYS means. Nowadays, most would probably answer it means to be “authentic.” But, we’re also clueless as to what that means. Depending on the translator, it could at any time have something to do with one’s feelings, thoughts, self-interest, conscience, beliefs or values. All decent things, but none worthy of anchoring your life to. Let’s explore the ramifications of those.

    If BTTYS means to “be true to your feelings,” that’s a recipe for total dysfunction. Our feelings change minute by minute. In the last ten minutes I’ve felt loved, rejected, confident, fearful, confused, proud, hopeful and like a complete loser. And that was just in trying to write these opening paragraphs (and walking to the bathroom in the coffee shop where I’m sitting.) Where in there is something I can be true to on a consistent basis? For the record, whether they say it or not, this is what most people are referring to when they proclaim BTTYS. “Do what you feel is right!” That’s a recipe for disaster. The Hunger Games is just a step or two away.

    If BTTYS means to “be true to your thoughts,” that’s not much better. My thoughts are all over the place. Currently I’m wondering, “Who buys the gas in the middle pump?” while trying to write something meaningful.

    If we’re talking “be true to your self-interest,” that’s fine until my self-interest and someone else’s self-interest conflict, basically eliminating marriage or parenting from the world.

    If it’s “be true to your conscience,” now we’re at least getting somewhere, since the Bible recognizes the power of a good conscience. Our conscience can at least help us avoid some bad decisions. But, the Bible also talks about an evil conscience, so we have that to wrestle with. And, I’m not certain in my ability to completely separate my conscience from my feelings, so I’m pretty sure if I consistently follow my conscience I’ll sometimes be following my ever-changing, self-interested feelings, getting me back to where I started.

    If “be true to my beliefs” is the focus, I have to admit that I regularly don’t know exactly what I believe, and often when I do know, those beliefs turn out to be wrong. I once believed I could lose weight by maintaining all of my current eating habits and simply drinking a lot more water. I just peed a lot. I still believe my Cleveland Browns fandom will lead to good things. You think (know) I’m delusional. I believe deeply in Jesus as the Son of God, and worthy of everything I have, but I don’t always act that way. One of the most powerful prayers in the Bible is when a father comes to Jesus and says, “I believe, help me in my unbelief.” That’s me. Every day. The totality of my beliefs are not an anchorpoint.

    Finally, if the BTTYS mandate is for one to “be true to your values,” then, like my beliefs, I have to know what I value. And I’ll be the first to admit that my values can change based on my self-interest. I had a value that I would never, ever pick up a Pittsburgh Steeler in fantasy football, until last month when I made the championship round, $350 was on the line, I badly needed a defense, and Pitt was playing the lowly Houston Texans offense. I caved. And lost anyway.

    I’m convinced most of the people elected to the U.S. Congress are good people who mean what they say they value when they run for election. But, we all see what happens when they get placed into the pressure cooker on the Hill. Their only value becomes re-election. And we hate them.

    We are not consistent beings. We need to acknowledge that and stop misleading ourselves by thinking we can be true to something that changes all the time. Besides, let’s preserve our ability to grow. I’m an adult man with a lot of experience and two college degrees, but I know I can still change and get better. I would never tell my seven year old daughter to be true to herself. She’d spend all her energy trying to create polyjuice potion and eating mac and cheese. I want her to grow in wisdom. And, unless you’re arrogant enough to believe you have nothing left to learn, you should want that for yourself too. I do.

    If we want to get somewhere, we have to be true to something that will never change, even if it’s not authentic to ourselves at that moment. When you run a marathon, you can be certain the finish line will be where you left it. It’s what makes the chafing endurable. But what if they moved the finish line every 15 minutes? You’d stop running. Immediately.

    God knows we are in this predicament of having nothing internal to moor our lives to. So He asks us to consider tying ourselves to Him. When King David, one of the greatest kings in the history of Ancient Israel, is about to die, he passes on some wisdom to his son, Solomon. He tells him:

    …Be strong, and show yourself a man, and keep the charge of the Lord your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn, that the Lord may establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’ 1 Kings 2:2–4

    David wants nothing more than a strong legacy, and he knows it’s possible if his son is not true to himself, but is instead true to God. He tells his son that to be a man means to do what God wants and says. And Solomon follows this advice, for awhile, and becomes great, until he eventually goes his own way, is true to himself, and brings about destruction of the unified kingdom.

    David’s advice is great, and we have it better than Solomon, because God made it easier for us to be true to Him by sending Jesus — God with us. That’s literally His name. God gave us a real-life example that doesn’t change that we can anchor to. For thousands of years, critics have tried to tear Jesus apart. He’s still here. We still celebrated Christmas last month. Billions of people celebrated actually.

    We can look at how Jesus thought, what he believed, what he felt, what he valued, and go that way. Yes, even when it conflicts with what we want at the moment. We’ll have to do some things that are initially uncomfortable, but any person who has faithfully put this plan into motion will tell you that he/she found tremendous fruit on the other side. And, there’s great freedom to be found when you can stop spending every waking minute trying to figure out who you are and what you believe and value, because it no longer matters. You can go for a walk instead. Or go to a movie.

    So, my advice is:

    1. Stop saying BTTYS.
    2. Stop believing BTTYS is the answer.
    3. Start looking for something/someone better than yourself to be true to.

    Ask yourself everyday, “Am I being true to that person/thing?”
    If that person is not Jesus, OK, but good luck finding someone as consistent, fruitful, powerful, and life-giving. There’s a reason billions of people have gone His way over many millennia (and have changed the freakin world in the process), and there’s a reason the worldly passions and crushes of every decade of our lives consistently fade away.

    Every time this year that I have a question about what to do or where to go, I hope I’m not true to myself, but I’m true to something much better than myself. That’s how we go to new places.

  title: My Hope For My Financial Future
  body: |-
    Look friends, I’m the kind of guy who thinks that making money is actually a noble pursuit. Maybe it’s the capitalist in me, but I look into the future and see opportunity coming. Not just to make money… but yes, to make money! I believe the days ahead will be better than the days I’ve yet seen, and that my children and their children will have more, not less, opportunity to lead and create and multiply than I have. When I look forward, I see dollar signs, okay?

    > But I just have to tell you: my hope for my financial future is NOT in finance.

    Just a couple of years ago, my wife and I took our hard-earned money and invested (heavily) in a privately funded movie that never made its money back (not even close). It looked like a good investment at the time… but it wasn’t. It’s been a total stinkball and laid our investment stores low. Right around that same time, we (and our friends… and our family…) invested (heavily) in oil wells in East Texas. Everything looked so promising, so above board… but then… the CEO stole all our money and the outfit went belly up. Another huge packet of investment money down the drain.

    What the fuss!!?? We are Jesus-loving people who only want to be faithful with our money. We felt these opportunities were God-ordained [Quick aside: just because they failed doesn’t mean that God didn’t send them], and that we were being great stewards by putting our money into these projects. And in spite of those angelic intentions, and the wholesome trust we put into these people to multiply our capital, we got a big mudpie right on the kisser for it.

    So what do we do now? Maybe it’s time to take our losses, lick our wounds, and buy bonds from here on out. No more crazy dreaming, no silly buying equity in a risky prospect. Maybe it’s time to get conservative and thinking smaller. Maybe…?

    As John Piper wonderfully emphasizes in this quick Bible study, being a financial steward (which is the intentional placement of money that doesn’t belong to you, in hopes of a good return) is an integral part of trusting God, not in opposition to trusting Him. So when I consider the future, I can either focus on my losses from the past (which, if nothing else, have certainly made me a sharper, wiser investor!) or consider my hope going forward. As a follower of Christ, I will choose the latter.

    I can be bold in the way that I give, aggressive in my investing, and dream big for my generations… because at the end of the day, I’m powerless to do any of those things, anyway. Deuteronomy 8 (one of my favorite gratitude passages and something we read as a family every Thanksgiving) tells us that God Alone gives us the ability to make money, and His promise of provision is what I hang my hat on every day, every week, and every year. That means that:

    Financial gains of any kind will be the result firstly of His generosity, NOT my efforts.
    His loving-kindness is our starting point when we think of any profitability or prosperity, NOT our acumen and savvy.
    His faithfulness is our hope going forward, not an ever-expanding balance sheet.
    God is the wellspring out of which flows courage for the days ahead; not my talents, multi-generational vision, or even all the good godly knowledge that the Scripture provides. He alone is my Rock, upon Whom I place all my trust.
    As 1 Timothy 1:17 definitively commands, “As for the rich in this present world [That’s you! That’s me!], instruct them not to be conceited and arrogant, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly and ceaselessly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.”

    This command is for people who are rich! And what should their relationship to their riches be? To not trust in it. Moreover, they should set their hope in God, Who (get this)… abundantly gives us all we need and more-! He gives to us for our enjoyment! How good is this Father of ours?? How outrageously does He love? How extravagant are His gifts?

    Again… I am for financial prosperity. I do not think that being wealthy is a sin (if it is, we’re all in trouble, as is Father Abraham). Moreover, my reading of Scripture tells me that God wants us to be people who not only multiply their finances, but who use them to build strong families, communities, and cities (I believe this so strongly that I and a couple of friends have created a blog to discuss just that)! He wants us to care for the poor, the orphan, the widow, the fatherless, the foreigner, the refugee, and to find those without hope in the world and show them a better Way. A Truth. A Life. A strong financial base isn’t just a luxury; it’s a necessity to do many of the things God calls us to.
